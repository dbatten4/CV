## Dominic Batten

Recent maths graduate and passionate problem solver with a love for beautiful and functional websites.

After a few years of various work placements and internships in the finance and law sector, I realised that it wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So I identified something that I do want to do with the rest of my life and decided to turn my interest in technology and design into a potential career by joining Makers Academy and learning how to code.

I'm currently looking to join an environment where I can continue to learn and be challenged, specifically in a role with a focus on TDD, cutting-edge front-end technologies and innovation.
