## Dominic Batten

Recent maths graduate and passionate problem solver with a love for beautiful and functional websites.

After a few years of various work placements and internships in the finance and law sector, I realised that it wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So I identified something that I do want to do with the rest of my life and decided to turn my interest in technology and design into a potential career by joining Makers Academy and learning how to code.

I'm currently looking to join an environment where I can continue to learn and be challenged, specifically in a role with a focus on TDD, cutting-edge front-end technologies and innovation.

## Skills

#### Front End Design

Throughout the duration of my learning experience so far I've developed a love for the creative aspect of software development and I enjoy the process of designing a website just as much as I enjoy building it. The following code examples are the ones I am most proud of in terms of design.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|[Grape](https://github.com/dbatten4/music_discover)|A social music discovery site using the Neo4j graph database and Ruby on Rails framework. Javascript and jQuery used to make the website responsive and interactive|
|[READMEter](https://github.com/dbatten4/readmeter)|A web app built on Angular which tells a user which of their GitHub repos don't have READMEs. jQuery used to create a responsive interface and SASS used to compile the CSS files (currently a work in progress)|
|[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/dbatten4/rps-challenge)|A simple game of RPS built in Ruby with the Sinatra framework. Used a Wacom tablet to draw the graphics and images|
